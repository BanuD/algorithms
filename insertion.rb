# SIMPLE

# a = [82, 54, 1, 12, 7, 23, 124, 5]

# RANDOM - NOT

### Performance of all of them are very close to each other. Need more detailed tests really.

# benchmark { sort1(a) }
# benchmark { sort2(b) }
# benchmark { sort3(c) }

sort4_time = benchmark { sort4(d) }

# p (sort2_time - sort1_time)
# p (sort3_time - sort1_time)
# p (sort2_time - sort3_time)
